# Verilog-HDL-Mini-Projects
This Repository contains a large number of mini projects. Most of these projects are also accompanied with their testbenches.
Through these projects, I have understood the various design styles and the best industry practices. 
There are more than 70 files present. Given below are some that I were able to recall: 

- Synchronous FIFO
- Data Transfer FSM
- Stream Cipher with text file implementation
- Memory Design:
  - Dual port asynchronous RAM
  - Single port syncronous RAM
  - Single port asynchronous RAM
  - ROM with hex file implementation
- Finite State Machines:
  - Metro Turnstile
  - Traffic Light - Semaphore
  - Pattern Detector - Overlapping and non Overlapping
- Sequential Logic:
  - pseudo random number generator 
  - linear feedback shift register
  - frequency divider 
  - counters
  - lathches 
- Combinational Logic:
  - ALU
  - ALU testbench that uses the GOLDEN method
  - Adders
      - behavioural
      - dataflow
      - structural
  - Priority encoder
  - Decoders
  - Multiplexers
